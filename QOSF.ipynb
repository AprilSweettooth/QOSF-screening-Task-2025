    "# Quantum State Preparation and Entanglement Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation provides a comprehensive framework for quantum state preparation and entanglement analysis using fundamental linear algebra operations. The code demonstrates how to construct quantum state vectors from complex amplitudes while adhering to the mathematical principles of quantum mechanics, without relying on high-level quantum computing libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## State Preparation Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The core functionality revolves around preparing normalized quantum state vectors from given complex amplitudes. For a two-qubit system, we take four complex numbers representing the amplitudes for the |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, and |11⟩ basis states. The implementation automatically checks and enforces normalization by calculating the Euclidean norm of the input amplitudes and scaling them appropriately if needed. This ensures that the total probability sums to one, satisfying the fundamental requirement of quantum state vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same approach extends to three-qubit systems, where eight complex amplitudes define the state in the computational basis from |000⟩ to |111⟩. The code includes robust error handling to validate input dimensions and uses numerical tolerances to account for floating-point precision issues that commonly arise in numerical computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Schmidt Decomposition and Entanglement Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant enhancement in this implementation is the incorporation of Schmidt decomposition for entanglement analysis. The Schmidt decomposition provides a powerful mathematical tool to analyze bipartite quantum systems by expressing the state in terms of orthogonal basis states for each subsystem. This is achieved through singular value decomposition (SVD) of the state vector reshaped into an appropriate matrix form.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation computes Schmidt coefficients, which are the singular values obtained from the SVD, and determines the Schmidt rank by counting non-zero coefficients. The Schmidt rank serves as a crucial indicator of entanglement: a rank of one signifies a product state that can be factored into separate states for each subsystem, while higher ranks indicate varying degrees of entanglement. For example, a Bell state exhibits Schmidt rank two with equal coefficients, representing maximal entanglement between two qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code includes functionality to automatically detect product states and analyze entanglement patterns in multi-qubit systems. For three-qubit states, different bipartitions can be examined, such as separating one qubit from the other two, revealing the complex entanglement structure that emerges in larger quantum systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tensor Product Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation demonstrates how composite quantum systems are constructed through tensor products of smaller subsystems. The tensor product operation, implemented using the Kronecker product, shows how individual qubit states combine to form multi-qubit states. This foundational operation illustrates the principle that the state space of a composite system is the tensor product of the state spaces of the component systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through examples like |0⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ = |01⟩ and |+⟩ ⊗ |+⟩, the code shows how familiar single-qubit states combine to create more complex multi-qubit states. This operation is essential for understanding how quantum systems scale and how entanglement can be created through various quantum operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing and Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive testing suite validates all aspects of the implementation. Unit tests verify normalization correctness, output dimensions, and mathematical properties of prepared states. The tests cover various scenarios including already normalized states, unnormalized inputs, complex-valued states, and special quantum states like Bell and GHZ states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing framework also validates the entanglement analysis by checking that product states correctly yield Schmidt rank one and entangled states show higher ranks. Tensor product operations are verified against known results to ensure mathematical correctness. These tests provide confidence in the implementation's accuracy and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation bridges abstract quantum mechanical concepts with concrete linear algebra operations. The state vector representation follows the standard quantum notation |ψ⟩ = Σ aᵢ|i⟩ where the coefficients aᵢ are complex probability amplitudes. The normalization condition |a₀|² + |a₁|² + ... = 1 ensures proper probability interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Schmidt decomposition implementation showcases the deep connection between quantum entanglement and linear algebra through the singular value decomposition. By reshaping the state vector into a matrix and performing SVD, we obtain the Schmidt coefficients that quantify entanglement between subsystems. This mathematical approach provides an operational method to analyze quantum correlations without requiring quantum gates or circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation serves as an educational tool for understanding quantum state representation and entanglement properties. It demonstrates how fundamental quantum concepts can be implemented using standard numerical computing techniques, making the abstract mathematics of quantum mechanics more accessible and concrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code provides a foundation for more advanced quantum information processing tasks, such as entanglement quantification, state tomography, and quantum circuit design. By building these capabilities from first principles, the implementation offers insights that might be obscured when using high-level quantum computing libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This quantum state preparation framework successfully implements core quantum mechanical concepts using fundamental linear algebra operations. The addition of Schmidt decomposition and tensor product operations provides a comprehensive toolkit for quantum state analysis, enabling detailed study of entanglement properties in multi-qubit systems. The implementation maintains mathematical rigor while being practically useful for both educational purposes and foundational quantum information processing tasks."
